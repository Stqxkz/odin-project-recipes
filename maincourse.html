            <li><a href="maincourses-list/steak.html">Steak</a></li>
            <p>A perfectly grilled, juicy steak served with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus, all drizzled with a rich red wine reduction.</p>
            <li><a href="maincourses-list/pasta.html">Pasta</a></li>
            <p>This delicious seafood pasta dish with shrimp, scallops, and fettuccine pasta is creamy, spicy, and full of flavor! Bay scallops are preferred, but the larger sea scallops can be used if they are cut in half.</p>
            <li><a href="maincourses-list/chicken.html">Chicken</a></li>
            <p>My version of chicken Parmesan is a little different than what they do in the restaurants, with less sauce and a crispier crust.</p>
        </ul>
