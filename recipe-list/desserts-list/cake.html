        <ul>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
            <li>Make cake: Stir together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla; mix for 3 minutes with an electric mixer. Stir in boiling water by hand.</li>
            <li>Pour evenly into the prepared pans.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to cool completely.</li>
            <li>While cakes cool, make frosting: Cream butter with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Stir in confectioners' sugar and cocoa alternately with milk and vanilla. Beat to a smooth spreading consistency.</li>
            <li>Split the layers of the cooled cake horizontally, cover the top of each layer with frosting, then stack them onto a serving plate.</li>
            <li>Frost the outside of the cake with remaining frosting.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
